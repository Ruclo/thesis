# Skill: /explore-test-context

**Purpose**: Discover repository-specific testing patterns, utilities, fixtures, and conventions

## Input
- **Required**: Repository root (implicit - current working directory)

## Output
- **No file artifacts** - findings are reported in conversation and used for subsequent code generation
- **Format**: Verbal summary of discovered patterns, utilities, fixtures, and conventions

## Role
You are exploring the test repository to understand its structure, patterns, and available utilities before generating test code.

## Exploration Phases

### Phase 1: Scan Documentation
Read `docs/` to understand testing conventions:
- Testing guidelines and best practices
- Pytest marker usage
- Fixture conventions
- Coding standards

**Report findings:**
- Key conventions documented
- Marker patterns used
- Special testing requirements

### Phase 2: Map Utilities
Analyze `libs/` and `utilities/` to discover available helpers:
- Helper classes and their methods
- Method signatures and parameters
- Constants (TIMEOUT_*, DEFAULT_*, etc.)
- Common patterns and utilities

**Report findings:**
- Available utility classes (e.g., VirtualMachineForTests, DataVolumeForTests)
- Commonly used methods (e.g., wait_for_vm_running, create_snapshot)
- Important constants (e.g., TIMEOUT_5MIN, DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS)

### Phase 3: Check Precedents
Look at existing tests in `tests/` to see valid patterns:
- Import patterns and structure
- Fixture usage examples
- Test class organization
- Assertion patterns
- Common test patterns

**Report findings:**
- Typical import statements
- Common fixtures used (e.g., namespace, admin_client, storage_class_matrix)
- Test file structure conventions
- Naming conventions (test_<feature>_<scenario>)

## Exploration Algorithm

```
1. READ docs/testing_guidelines.md (if exists)
   - Extract conventions
   - Note marker patterns

2. GLOB utilities/*.py
   FOR each utility_file:
     - READ file
     - EXTRACT class names
     - EXTRACT method signatures
     - EXTRACT constants
     - SUMMARIZE findings

3. GLOB tests/**/*.py (sample 5-10 files)
   FOR each test_file:
     - READ file
     - EXTRACT import patterns
     - EXTRACT fixture usage
     - NOTE test structure
     - SUMMARIZE patterns

4. REPORT comprehensive findings:
   - Available utilities summary
   - Common fixtures summary
   - Import patterns summary
   - Testing conventions summary
```

## Example Output

After exploration, provide a summary like:

```
Repository Exploration Complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📚 Documentation Findings:
  - Tests use @pytest.mark.polarion() for test case IDs
  - Architecture markers: @pytest.mark.arm64, @pytest.mark.s390x
  - Tiering: @pytest.mark.tier1, @pytest.mark.tier2

🔧 Available Utilities:
  Classes:
    - VirtualMachineForTests (from utilities.virt)
    - DataVolumeForTests (from utilities.storage)

  Methods:
    - wait_for_vm_running(vm, timeout=300)
    - create_snapshot(vm, snapshot_name)
    - ssh_to_vm(vm, command)

  Constants:
    - TIMEOUT_5MIN = 300
    - TIMEOUT_10MIN = 600
    - DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS = "ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd"

🧪 Common Fixtures:
  - namespace (function scope) - provides isolated test namespace
  - admin_client (session scope) - provides cluster admin client
  - storage_class_matrix (parametrized) - tests across storage classes

📋 Import Patterns:
  - from ocp_resources.virtual_machine import VirtualMachine
  - from utilities.virt import VirtualMachineForTests
  - from utilities.constants import TIMEOUT_5MIN

🏗️ Test Structure Conventions:
  - File naming: test_<feature_name>.py
  - Test naming: test_<action>_<expected_outcome>
  - Class grouping: class Test<FeatureName>
  - Shared preconditions in class docstrings
```

## Key Principles

1. **Thorough but Focused**: Explore enough to understand patterns, don't read everything
2. **No Hallucination**: Only report what actually exists in the repository
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for common patterns across multiple files
4. **Actionable Findings**: Report findings that will be useful for code generation

## Constraints

- **Must not hallucinate**: Only report actual findings from the repository
- **Must verify**: Check that classes/methods actually exist
- **No file output**: This skill does NOT create context.json or any other file
- **Conversational output**: Findings are reported in the conversation for immediate use

## Usage

```bash
# Explore repository context
/explore-test-context

# The findings will be used by subsequent /generate-pytest or /generate-std calls
```

## Difference from V2 (Full)

In v2.2, this skill:
- ❌ Does NOT create context.json
- ✅ Reports findings in conversation
- ✅ Findings are used immediately but not cached

In v2 (full), the same skill:
- ✅ Creates context.json for reuse
- ✅ Enables context caching across multiple test generations

## Reusability
**Medium** - Useful before generating tests in this repository, but findings are not persisted for reuse

## Dependencies
- Glob tool (file discovery)
- Grep tool (pattern searching)
- Read tool (file content)
