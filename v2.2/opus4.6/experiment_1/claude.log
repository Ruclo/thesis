The test file and conftest have been generated. The file is located at:

**Test file:** `tests/install_upgrade_operators/common_instancetypes_deployment/test_common_instancetypes_deployment.py`
**Conftest:** `tests/install_upgrade_operators/common_instancetypes_deployment/conftest.py`

Key implementation details:
- Uses `ResourceEditorValidateHCOReconcile` for HCO CR patching with automatic reconciliation waiting and teardown restore
- Uses `VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype.get()` and `VirtualMachineClusterPreference.get()` with the RedHat vendor label selector to check for common instance type resources
- Follows the existing patterns from `tests/install_upgrade_operators/` (same fixture structure as `updated_hco_cr`)
- All 4 STD scenarios implemented: default behavior, disable, enable, and persistence after reconciliation
