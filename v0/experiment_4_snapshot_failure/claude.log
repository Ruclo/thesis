● I'll help you implement this test plan for VM snapshot restore with runStrategy RerunOnFailure. Let me start with the Context Exploration phase  
  to understand the existing testing architecture.

● Excellent! I now have a comprehensive understanding of the testing architecture. Let me proceed to Step 2: Code Generation.                      
                                                                                                                                                   
  Let me first check the existing snapshot test directory structure.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                   
● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                   
● Now let me check the existing snapshot test patterns to ensure consistency.

● Now I'll create the comprehensive test implementation for the snapshot restore run strategy scenarios.
